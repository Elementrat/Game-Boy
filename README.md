A Discord Boy

To run, you'll need to:

1) Install NodeJS
2) Open the repo, 
3) "npm install nodemon -g"
4) "npm install typescript -g"

To get compilation going with auto-compile on code-change: tsc --lib es6 --outDir build .\server.ts -w
Then to serve the bot (with auto-update when code changes) cd into /build and use: nodemon ./server.js -w

You'll need one more piece, but bot's secret, DM me for that!
